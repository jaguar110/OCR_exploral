## 📊 Overview

This project explores **NFL player tracking data** for advanced **feature engineering, modeling, and predictive analysis**.  
The dataset combines player attributes, tracking data, and play-level context — creating a **multi-dimensional temporal-spatial dataset** ideal for **trajectory prediction and decision modeling**.

---

## 🧍‍♂️ Player Attributes

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `position` | Role classification (QB, WR, CB, etc.) — critical for position-specific modeling |
| `height`, `weight` | Physical attributes affecting speed/acceleration |
| `displayName` | Player identification |

---

## 🏟️ Game and Play Identifiers

### `game_id`
- **Definition:** Unique numeric ID for each NFL game.  
- **Scope:** Each game has its own unique `game_id`.  
- **Usage:** Used to group plays/events per game.  

### `play_id`
- **Definition:** Unique ID for a play *within a game*.  
- **Scope:** Unique per game, not across all games.  
- **Usage:** Combine `game_id + play_id` to reference a specific play.

## ⚡ Tracking Data

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `x`, `y` | Player field position (0–120 yards × 0–53.3 yards) |
| `s` | Speed (yards/second) |
| `a` | Acceleration (yards/second²) |
| `dir` | Movement angle (0–360°) |
| `o` | Body/shoulder orientation (0–360°) |
| `dis` | Distance traveled since previous frame |
| `frameId` | Frame identifier (temporal sequence) |
| `event` | Play phase marker (`ball_snap`, `pass_forward`, `pass_arrived`) |

These features form the foundation for **trajectory prediction models**.

---

## 🧠 Situational Context

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `down`, `yardsToGo` | Key strategic indicators |
| `offenseFormation`, `defendersInTheBox` | Formation indicators |
| `passResult` | Target variable (`Complete`, `Incomplete`, `Intercepted`) |
| `expectedPoints`, `expectedPointsAdded` | Value-based metrics |
| `absoluteYardlineNumber` | Field position context |

> These features define **strategic context** that shapes player behavior.

## 🔗 Dataset Joining Structure

All datasets connect through key identifiers:

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|----------|
| `gameId` | Links all data to specific games |
| `playId` | Links tracking, plays, and player_play data |
| `nflId` | Links player data to tracking and player_play |
| `frameId` | Temporal ordering within plays |

**Cardinality:** Tracking data forms a *many-to-one* relationship with other tables → rich hierarchical structure.

## 📈 Feature Correlations & Relationships

### 🗺️ Spatial Correlations
- `x, y ↔ field zones`: Position influences play type (e.g., red zone)
- `x, y ↔ trajectories`: Identify player movement patterns
- **Distance to nearest opponent** → strong predictor of receiver success

### 🏃 Kinematic Correlations
- `speed ↔ acceleration`: Momentum patterns  
- `speed ↔ position`: Speed varies by role (WR > linemen)  
- `acceleration ↔ direction changes`: Indicates cuts/breaks

### 🔄 Directional Correlations
- `direction ↔ (x, y) changes`: Movement vector  
- `orientation ↔ direction delta`: Agility indicator  
- `angular velocity`: Predicts route breaks  

### ⏱️ Temporal Correlations
- `frameId ↔ event`: Segment play phases  
- `time_to_pass_forward`: Prediction horizon  
- `frames_since_snap`: Temporal context  

### 🤝 Player Interaction Correlations
- **Distance between players**: Multi-player dynamics  
- **Defender proximity**: Defensive pressure  
- **Separation from coverage**: Pass targeting probability
